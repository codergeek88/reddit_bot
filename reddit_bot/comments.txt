Can someone explain what happened to the hf on Friday and the margin call - in simple language please, any language. It appears the market is waiting for a further shoe to drop but I don't know where and what that is. Still in GME CC's for the week at 200 and 250 for some income.

PLTR is an strong sub 20. I’m loading up on more if we continue to tank. I have used their products for work doing some.... things. They have completely revolutionized how the DOD/GOV does business.

Jim Cramer always thought that he was a meme.
------------------
Jim Cramer cut in front of me in the fast-pass line at cedar point & he didn’t even go on the ride
------------------
And you’re so lonely and retarded you sit in the GME thread and try to assault the mentally disabled which is even more fucked up.
------------------
>Jim Cramer always thought that 7-11 was only open for one day in July.

imagine having a "Jim Cramer always thought" meme
------------------
Been in rocket for 100 since Jan. It was heavily shorted. But it's cheap and it pays dividends and is undervalued some. I like it and have. I just don't want GME gang getting in on it. They stress me the fuck out.

Jim Cramer orders his salad well done
------------------
I have some GME not as much as id like to have tho. Soemthings better than nothing
------------------
Calls on GME partnering with retailers to provide service and support for gaming hardware, in addition to a robust online presence to consolidate a fractured game industry under one third-party entity for sales and support. They are uniquely positioned to do this. Please correct me.
------------------
AMC YOLO
------------------
This guy must be Cramer's student, he enjoys being downvoted
------------------
More people need to get into amc so we can skyrocket it

Jim Cramer eats candy bars with the wrapper still on...*at the movies.*
------------------
Can someone explain what demo day is and why is affects PLTR?
------------------
My guy, don't drink the GME coolaid. Be open to negative sentiment. 

If you're only looking for people saying "good job" you're doomed to not know when you've made a mistake.
------------------
Just my bi-monthly check to see if I can comment again or if the GME influx is still ruining WSB
------------------
You’re the guys that’s sour because they didnt get into gme early... I’ve heard of you. Sour sour people that hate the thought of other people reaping riches cause they can’t.
------------------
PLTR down ~3% each day.

>Only way is up I guess

------------------
Jim Cramer microwaves everything in Styrofoam containers.
------------------
Gme> netflix and chill
------------------
Ah yes pltr bag homder checking in. Fek
------------------
I’m sure you could find plenty of analysis why it’s worth 22-26$...40 was gme hype train shrapnel before earnings.  Valuation vs PPE ration is high but consider potential market penetration it’s really betting on huge growth in an untapped industry - I guess? I think I don’t know fuck it

Here's one about Jim Cramer's bunghole:
